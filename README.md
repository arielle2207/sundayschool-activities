# Sunday School Activities (SK1)

This repository contains a growing collection of interactive games and activities designed for Sunday School children, primarily aged **7–10**.

The materials are created to support our current Sunday School teaching, which is based on **John R. W. Stott’s _Understanding the Bible_**. The goal of these activities is to help children engage with and understand the Bible in a fun, accessible, and age-appropriate way.

## 📚 Teaching Context

- Primary age group: **7–10 years old**
- Teaching material: *Understanding the Bible* by John R. W. Stott

## 🌏 Language Use

As part of our teaching context, we also hope to introduce children to **Mandarin**.

- Some content is bilingual (English / Mandarin)
- In cases where translations differ slightly, users are encouraged to use their own discretion and adapt the material to their teaching needs
